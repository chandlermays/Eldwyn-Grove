# Eldwyn-Grove

Eldwyn Grove is a fantasy-themed action RPG prototype focused on real-time movement and combat. This demo features WASD controls and responsive swordplay, allowing players to explore a stylized world, cut down roaming skeletons, and slice slimes into smaller forms.

The goal is to eventually expand Eldwyn Grove into a rich, immersive world featuring resource gathering, crafting, and narrative-driven quests.
